## Features
* Based on [HDR's Game Boy Camera flash cart](https://github.com/HDR/Gameboy-Camera-Flashcart) schematic
  * Flashable with stock or custom ROMs
  * 2MB flash & integrated switch allows for saving 2 different ROMs (photos shared between ROMs)
  * FRAM eliminates use of battery for saved data
* Eliminates the sensor board & combines the components into a single PCB
* Replaces original lens with an iPhone XR lens array for thinner profile
* Glass lens cover to keep dust & debris from damaging the lens
* All new redesigned cartridge shell based to a standard Game Boy cart
* Custom designed label sticker

## Disclaimer
**WARNING: This is a difficult mod and requires advanced soldering skills & tools** due to the fine pitch of donor components and easily damagable resin sensor. I am not responsible for any harm done to you, your property, or family. Because of the complication required for this mod, personal support will be limited. Order any parts at your own risk!
